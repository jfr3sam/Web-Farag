      <h2>WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <p>
        Next-generation (NextG) networks including 6G cellular network technologies are expected to be a major leap forward from the current 5G. NextG networks are envisioned to offer AI/ML-embedded smart solutions to ensure significantly higher speeds, lower latency, greater capacity, and more importantly energy efficiency and environment-friendly than the current standards. Therefore, the key requirements for NextG are the “smart” and “green” solutions. This means that these technologies must be designed to minimize their environmental impact and best utilize the available limited resources and offer better quality of experience. NextG networks will use various technologies to achieve this goal, including; (a) smart use of new spectrum bands that are not currently used for cellular communications. These bands are less crowded than the bands used by 5G, which will help to reduce the energy consumption of NextG networks. Additionally, these networks will use more efficient modulation and coding schemes that will allow them to transmit more data over the same amount of spectrum, which will also reduce energy consumption. (b) Employing energy-saving technologies such as sleep modes for devices and energy-saving techniques for infrastructure elements (i.e., base stations, radio resource heads, etc.). In addition to being green, NextG networks are also envisioned as "smart." This means that they will be able to adapt to the needs of users and applications. For example, the NextG networks will be able to prioritize traffic from certain applications, such as self-driving cars, over other traffic. This will help ensure critical applications have the bandwidth they need to operate reliably.

        The development of the NextG network and technologies are expected to be a major technological breakthrough and will offer significant improvements over 5G in terms of speed, latency, capacity, and energy efficiency. They will also be more intelligent and adaptable, which will allow them to meet the needs of a wide range of users and applications.

        The Green and Smart G workshop aims to bring together researchers working on selected areas in NextG network along with various technologies and application domains, such as applications for smart and green cities, smart and green communities, smart and green autonomous driving, cloudification, etc. The authors are expected to share their new ideas, latest findings and results in the following topics but not limited to:
