      <h2>WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <p>
        Trust and security are essential components of cloud technological frameworks. The field of cloud trust and security is constantly changing influenced by new technologies and evolving threats. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia to discuss upcoming trends and advancements in cloud trust and security that will impact how organizations trust cloud services to secure their data and applications in the Cloud.
One major trend is the growing popularity of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments, where organizations utilize multiple cloud providers and combine on-premises infrastructure with cloud services for improved flexibility and scalability. However, this shift poses new trust and security challenges that demand innovative solutions. Another important trend is the emphasis on data privacy and compliance, as regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR require organizations to prioritize data protection and demonstrate compliance through encryption, data classification, and other privacy-enhancing technologies.
The future of cloud security also involves the adoption of a zero-trust architecture, moving away from traditional perimeter defense models towards continuously verifying user identities and device integrity for better protection against advanced cyber threats. Additionally, AI and ML technologies are expected to play a significant role in enhancing threat detection, analyzing user behavior, and automating incident response for faster and more efficient trust and security operations.
This workshop provides researchers and practitioners an opportunity to showcase and discuss their contributions to trustworthy and secure cloud services. Authors are expected to share their new ideas, latest findings and results in the following topics but not limited to:
